                <!-- Write at least two paragraphs about yourself. Minimum 50 words per paragraph. -->
                My name's Pai, pronounced like the number, I'm from Taiwan and I take any and all pronouns (use whatever you like).&#9996;
                I'm a fan of video games, Some of the genres I love are immersive sims (Dishonored series, Deux Ex), 
                simulation games (Trauma Center, Story of Seasons (formerly known as Harvest Moon series)), 
                turn-based tactical games (Fire Emblem series, Advance Wars series, Triangle Strategy), 
                puzzle games (Tetris) and various RPGs (Mass Effect Trilogy, Persona series, SMT series, Etrian Odyssey series).
                I'm taking this program to focus on UIUX, as I aim to be a GUI artist/designer.
                Hoping to learn more skills for things I might not have gone out of my way to learn myself! 
                Like more in-depth coding (I have basic experience with HTML from coding neopets pet websites way wayyy back in the day).

            <!-- !NEW! ADDED HEADER AND HOBBY LIST List at least 2 of your hobbies (use appropriate html element for a list) -->
            <h4>Some Hobbies</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Digital illustration</li>
                <li>Playing Games</li>
                <li>Eating</li>
                <li>Enjoying Music</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Additional Stuff Below</h4>
            I can't find a place to fit in <sup>superscript</sup>, <em>emphasis</em>, 
            and <abbr title="abbrviation">abbr</abbr> on my text above so here's a new 
            line that includes these three things.<br>
            <br>
            By the way, I think this whole page looks better when it's half screen, since I haven't figured out how to make my first "About me" 
            paragraph not run all the way across the page. I'm pretty sure it's a CSS thing, so I'm not going to get too far ahead of 
            myself on this assignment I'm already messing with style div indents as you can probably tell.
